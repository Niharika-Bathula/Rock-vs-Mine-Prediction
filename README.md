# About
Outwardly SONAR technique has exploited the discovery of rocks and minerals which would have been very difficult otherwise. The technique exploits certain parameters which will aid to detect the surface targets or obstacle such as a rock or a mine. Machine learning has drawn the attention of maximum part of todayâ€™s emerging technology, related from banking to many consumer and product based industries, by showing the advancements in the predictive analytics. This prediction can be done using machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression which is implemented in google colab.

# DataSet
The dataset has been collected from UCI Repository. It has come across 61 features which define and differentiate Rocks and Mines and comprises of 209 samples. This data is used for training and testing purpose. The Last column in this dataset indicates that, whether it's a mine or a rock, which is useful in prediction. The dataset is included in this repository.

 Used many algorithms and came to know that KNN is giving me good result.

I also learned about how different python libraries like scikit learn, numpy and pandas can be used to build and train the model.
Model evaluation using input data was also done in this project.
